# Oxygen Not Included Template Editor
This is a (very) rudimentary template editor for Oxygen Not Included.

# Changelog
### Version 0.1
- All buttons now work.
- Added template parser for use with existing templates. It will still explode if it uses unimplemented elements.
- Default to your gamedir for save/load templates if it can be found.

#### Known issues
- Not all elements are present yet
- When loading a template the UI won't update if you make changes, but it IS making the changes underneath. Will fix on the next release.
